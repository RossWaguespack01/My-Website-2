  <h2>What are my influences?</h2>
  <ul>
<li>I grew up on early 2000 animated shows, with Adventure Time being my favorite show of all time.</li>
<li>The Spider-Verse movies had a major impact on what I wanted to do with my career. That was the movie that made me want to be an animator.</li>
<li>I try to make my comedy and conversations within my animation as fresh and real as possible, Most of the voice acting is with my friends so the acting is fresh and feels authentic.</li>
